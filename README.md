CREATE DATABASE studentcoursedb;


Update your `src/main/resources/application.properties` credentials.

3. **Run**
   ./mvnw clean install
   ./mvnw spring-boot:run

## 🧪 Tests

- Repository and service layer unit/integration tests in `/src/test`
- H2 used for tests for speed and isolation

## 🏆 Challenges & Solutions
